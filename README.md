# Intro To Python (2023)

This course, 'Intro To Python', will be offered at Erasmus School of Economics in 2023. The course is being offered in collaboration with Turing Students Rotterdam (TSR). 

The repository includes notebooks that will be used to teach programming principles, Python syntax, pythonic style of code, and a little bit of data structures and algorithms.

Soon the README will contain a syllabus of what is covered, the lecture notebooks and slide decks, and possibly assignment notebooks as well.
